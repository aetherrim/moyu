# Quiet Quitting Today Privacy Policy

Quiet Quitting Today is a purely local iOS app. It does not send any data to servers, does not connect to analytics providers, and does not attempt to identify users. This policy explains the very limited ways the app handles information.

## Information We Collect

We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information on our servers. All content you provide (birth date, biological sex, notification preference, and language) stays on your device inside `UserDefaults`.

## Network Access

Quiet Quitting Today works fully offline. The app never connects to the internet after it is installed, other than using Apple’s system services such as the App Store for updates.

## Local Notifications

If you enable the optional daily reminder, the app schedules a local notification using iOS. This reminder is generated on-device and is never sent to us or shared with third parties.

## Contact
